# Drug-traceability using Blockchain
This project aims to create a decentralized, secure system for drug traceability using blockchain technology. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, it ensures transparency and authenticity of drugs, preventing counterfeit drugs from entering the market. The system allows users to register drugs, track their details, and transfer ownership with a secure and transparent process.

## Features
• Drug Registration: Register drugs on the blockchain with information such as drug name, manufacturer, batch number, and unique drug ID.

• Drug Details Retrieval: Fetch details of a drug using its unique ID to verify its authenticity and trace its history.

• Ownership Transfer: Transfer ownership of drugs securely between parties, recording each transfer on the blockchain for a transparent ownership trail.

• MetaMask Integration: Allows interaction with the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask for wallet connection and transaction signing.

## Technologies Used
• Solidity: Smart contract development for Ethereum.

• Ethereum: Decentralized network for deploying and interacting with smart contracts.

• Web3.js: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain.

• MetaMask: A browser extension for interacting with Ethereum, handling wallet management and transaction signing.

• Remix IDE: Online IDE used for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

• VS Code: Code editor for writing HTML, JavaScript, and other front-end code.

• JavaScript (HTML, CSS): Front-end interface for users to interact with the system.

## Usage
• Register a Drug: Input the drug ID, name, manufacturer, and batch number to register a new drug on the blockchain.

• Fetch Drug Details: Input the drug ID to retrieve details like the drug’s name, manufacturer, batch number, and the current owner.

• Transfer Ownership: Input the drug ID and the new owner’s Ethereum address to transfer ownership of the drug.

## Future Enhancements
• Extend the system to allow for multiple drug attributes and more comprehensive tracking.

• Enable notifications for ownership transfers or changes in drug status.

• Improve the JS and build an app which is mobile and desktop friendly.
